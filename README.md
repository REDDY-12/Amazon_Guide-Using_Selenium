# Amazon_Guide-Using_Selenium
Using Selenium library in Python, I have created a bot that helps you in shopping, updating necessary information and other major tasks




Drawbacks in the code:
1) When you go for sign in and enter correct password in the given no of tries, your program runs well but later on if we sign out, the web page works fine but the code creates some infinite loop.
2) When we are working on sign up page there are 2 types of forms displayed randomly. One of the form works well but the other displays a puzzle and stops our bot from running. So we cannot automate that second form.
